WebToBook APK Build Guide
==============================================

Your APK is now ready to build with a native WebView wrapper!

IMPORTANT: Update the Replit URL in App.js:
- Find: const WEB_APP_URL = 'https://webtobook.replit.dev';
- Replace with your actual Replit app URL

BUILD COMMAND:
eas build --platform android

The build will:
1. Embed your web app in a native container
2. Display it like a native app with smooth performance
3. Support all downloads and features
4. Take 5-15 minutes to complete
5. Generate an APK file you can install on any Android phone

After build completes, you'll get a download link for the APK file.
