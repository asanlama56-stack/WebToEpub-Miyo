QUICK BUILD STEPS:
==================

1. Open terminal
2. Run EXACTLY this command:

cd /home/runner/workspace/expo-app
eas build --platform android

That's it. The folder is now completely isolated with no conflicts.

The build will:
- Take 10-15 minutes
- Install dependencies fresh in EAS environment
- Generate APK file
- Give you a download link

DO NOT run from parent directory - run from INSIDE expo-app folder.
