JAVA 17 WORKAROUND - BUILD WITH JAVA 16/11 COMPATIBLE
==========================================================

The issue: EAS builds require Java 17, but environment has Java 16

SOLUTION: Use Java 11 compatibility in Gradle configuration

FILES CREATED:
- gradle.properties (Java version settings)
- build.gradle (Gradle compatibility)
- app.gradle (Android app config)

NEW BUILD COMMAND:
cd /home/runner/workspace/expo-app
eas build --platform android --profile production

WHAT THIS DOES:
1. Sets Java source/target to 11 (compatible with Java 16)
2. Configures Gradle 7.4.2 (doesn't need Java 17)
3. Sets Android API 33 (latest stable)
4. Enables proper caching and parallelization

IF THIS STILL FAILS:
The EAS service may need a newer profile. Contact Expo support
and mention: "User needs Java 11 compatible build, not Java 17 requirement"

ALTERNATIVE (Local Build):
If EAS continues to fail, build locally:
1. Install Android Studio
2. Open expo-app folder
3. Click Build → Build APK
4. Get APK from app/release/
