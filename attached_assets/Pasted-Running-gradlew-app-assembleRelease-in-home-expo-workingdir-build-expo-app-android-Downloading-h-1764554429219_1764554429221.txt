Welcome to Gradle 8.8!
Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Running Gradle on Java 22
 - Configurable Gradle daemon JVM
- Improved IDE performance for large projects
For more details see https://docs.gradle.org/8.8/release-notes.html
To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.8/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build
